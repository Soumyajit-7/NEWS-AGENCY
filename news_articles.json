The gig economy is also gaining traction, providing opportunities for graduates to work on a freelance basis. Additionally, the government is taking steps to improve the employability of graduates, with initiatives like the National Career Service Portal and the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the placement scenario in India is complex and multifaceted. While there are challenges that need to be addressed, there are also opportunities that need to be leveraged.
